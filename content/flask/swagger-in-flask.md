description = "Flask is a micro web framework written in Python with no extra baggage attached. You can build a Flask application up and running in couple of minutes. Flask comes with a simple web server to test the application during development. But you need a production ready web server, like Nginx, for final deployment. In this series I will discuss about some real world applications where we used Flask. There are lot of extensions available to build complex applications."
