# Hugo Theme - Runnable
Hugo theme based on [runnable](https://runnable.com/docker/) page.

The beauty of this theme is, the content is organized as sections. Posts are grouped under sections, like, docker, python etc. The main page will display posts under each section. This theme is suitable for creating educational content as [runnable](https://runnable.com) did for Docker.

# Gistify Integrated

This theme includes a shortcode, `mygist` which uses [gistify](https://gistify.saisyam.com) to embed any source file from Github into the webpage.
